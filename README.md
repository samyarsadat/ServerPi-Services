----
This repository contains Docker Compose and other configuration files for services and tools I self-host on a Raspberry Pi 4B (4GB). I have been hosting these services for almost a year now and have finally decided to make this repository public.

I've taken inspiration and learnt from many other repositories and tutorials, but I have listed all of my main sources [below](#sources--tutorials). Note that this is most likely not an exhaustive list, as I did most of my research last year and have since forgotten a lot.

Many of the services I have set up require certain "secret" variables (passwords, API keys, etc.). I store these secrets in `secrets.env` files located in the root directory of each service (the same directory that contains the `docker-compose.yaml` file). I, of course, have omitted these files from this repository, so you will have to create them yourself before running the desired service. The variables that need to be set in these `secrets.env` files are listed in `secrets.txt` files, located in the root directory of each service ([example](authelia/secrets.txt)). If there is no `secrets.txt` file in the root directory of a service, then that service has no secret variables.

I'm not going to get into the details of how everything is set up, as there are many tutorials out there explaining everything I have done here in great detail. But as a general overview, most services are reverse-proxied using Caddy and (if needed) protected by authentication using Authelia. Monitoring is done using a combination of Loki (for log collection) and Prometheus (for other statistics) and displayed using Grafana.

Services inside of the [`services`](/services) directory are all on an internal Docker network, while ones located inside of the [`external-services`](/external-services) directory are either running in `host` networking mode or don't need to be exposed to the outside world at all. Note that all websites in [`sites`](/sites) are also on the internal Docker network.

I don't actively use most of the services here, and I set them up mostly for fun, learning, and experimentation. Although I will admit, the WireGuard server has been quite useful.
